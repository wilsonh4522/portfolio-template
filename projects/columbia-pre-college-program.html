            <h1 class="margin text-center">Columbia Pre-College Program</h1>
            <p>Took a course on cybersecurity for a week over the summer</p>
            <p>I took a course in Cybersecurity and for 5 days we talked about how it works. We got a feel of what college life was like. It went from 11am-4pm. We had 4 hours of class time and a 2-hour break between the class time. During those two hours, we could eat, attend lectures and events, and explore campus. At the end, we did a presentation about the research we did in a hacking group (Cozy Bear). We learned a lot about how hacking works. I learned how actors get into their victim's system by using malware, trojans, phishing, and more. We learned about some major attacks such as the hacking of the 2016 election, Stuxnet, and more. In the end, we would have to do a report and presentation about a hacking group (Cozy Bear). I learned a lot from this course and it even opened up a potential career path in cybersecurity. </p>
            <p>During the final days I did a project with a partner about a hacking group called cozy bears; we fully analyzed them on who they are and also did a full writeup about them.</p>

            <p>Some of the work we did were about present events. For example we had to summarize the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf">2023 National Cyber Security Strategy</a> and read lots of books about current events in cybersecurity</p>
